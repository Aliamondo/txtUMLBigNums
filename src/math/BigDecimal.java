	 * decimal point will be inserted with the scale specifying the
	 * number of characters to the right of the decimal point.
	 * {@code '0'} characters are added to the left of the converted
	 * unscaled value as necessary.  If no character precedes the
	 * decimal point after this insertion then a conventional
	 * {@code '0'} character is prefixed.
	 *
	 * <p>Otherwise (that is, if the scale is negative, or the
	 * adjusted exponent is less than {@code -6}), the number will be
	 * converted to a character form using exponential notation.  In
	 * this case, if the converted {@code BigInteger} has more than
	 * one digit a decimal point is inserted after the first digit.
	 * An exponent in character form is then suffixed to the converted
	 * unscaled value (perhaps with inserted decimal point); this
	 * comprises the letter {@code 'E'} followed immediately by the
	 * adjusted exponent converted to a character form.  The latter is
	 * in base ten, using the characters {@code '0'} through
	 * {@code '9'} with no leading zeros, and is always prefixed by a
	 * sign character {@code '-'} (<tt>'&#92;u002D'</tt>) if the
	 * adjusted exponent is negative, {@code '+'}
	 * (<tt>'&#92;u002B'</tt>) otherwise).
	 *
	 * <p>Finally, the entire string is prefixed by a minus sign
	 * character {@code '-'} (<tt>'&#92;u002D'</tt>) if the unscaled
	 * value is less than zero.  No sign character is prefixed if the
	 * unscaled value is zero or positive.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Examples:</b>
	 * <p>For each representation [<i>unscaled value</i>, <i>scale</i>]
	 * on the left, the resulting string is shown on the right.
	 * <pre>
	 * [123,0]      "123"
	 * [-123,0]     "-123"
	 * [123,-1]     "1.23E+3"
	 * [123,-3]     "1.23E+5"
	 * [123,1]      "12.3"
	 * [123,5]      "0.00123"
	 * [123,10]     "1.23E-8"
	 * [-123,12]    "-1.23E-10"
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * <b>Notes:</b>
	 * <ol>
	 *
	 * <li>There is a one-to-one mapping between the distinguishable
	 * {@code BigDecimal} values and the result of this conversion.
	 * That is, every distinguishable {@code BigDecimal} value
	 * (unscaled value and scale) has a unique string representation
	 * as a result of using {@code toString}.  If that string
	 * representation is converted back to a {@code BigDecimal} using
	 * the {@link BigDecimalImplementation#BigDecimalImplementation(String)}
	 * constructor, then the original
	 * value will be recovered.
	 *
	 * <li>The string produced for a given number is always the same;
	 * it is not affected by locale.  This means that it can be used
	 * as a canonical string representation for exchanging decimal
	 * data, or as a key for a Hashtable, etc.  Locale-sensitive
	 * number formatting and parsing is handled by the {@link
	 * java.text.NumberFormat} class and its subclasses.
	 *
	 * <li>The {@link #toEngineeringString} method may be used for
	 * presenting numbers with exponents in engineering notation, and the
	 * {@link #setScale(int,RoundingMode) setScale} method may be used for
	 * rounding a {@code BigDecimal} so it has a known number of digits after
	 * the decimal point.
	 *
	 * <li>The digit-to-character mapping provided by
	 * {@code Character.forDigit} is used.
	 *
	 * </ol>
